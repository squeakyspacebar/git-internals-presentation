						<h2>Welcome to Git!</h2>
						<aside class="notes" data-markdown>
							During this presentation, I will be using the command line (also known as a terminal, or a command-line shell, which is a technical term for art for an operating system interaface, specifically). Please don't be intimidated, as becoming familiar with the terminal is part of understanding how so many developers.

							I grew up learning Windows back when Windows was still a flimsy graphical interface and many actions were simply faster and easier by dropping down into the MS-DOS CLI. Not to seem condescending, but earnestly, if a six-year-old can pick up working with a command line interface, so can you.

						<p>A lot of people use Git without understanding how it works internally, forming a roadblock to learning advanced usage.</p>

						<p>Hopefully this talk will help alleviate the above problem.</p>

						<p>What is a version control system?</p>
					</section>
					<section>
						<p>A version control system (VCS) is basically a system for recording and managing the history of changes made within a project.</p>

						<p>Uses of version control</p>
						<img style="width: 100%" data-src="img/ecce_homo.jpg">
					</section>
					<section>
						<p>An amazing backup system (you can roll back changes and recover from accidental deletions)</p>
						<p><em>We can bring back that paragraph we accidentally deleted last week.</em></p>
					</section>
					<section>
						<p>Faster recovery from errors and thereby cheaper experimentation (you can recover previous state by using simple commands instead of manually reproducing or removing your changes)</p>
						<p><em>We can try out an experimental structure and simply discard it if we donâ€™t like it.</em></p>
					</section>
					<section>
						<p>Promotes transparency and facilitates reproducibility (you can see how a project developed and who made which changes)</p>
						<p><em>Louis introduced that typo into the article a few versions ago.</em></p>
					</section>
					<section>
						<p>Easier collaboration (you can manage and merge isolated changes more easily)</p>
						<p><em>We'll just merge your changes to the concluding sections with our edits to the introduction.</em></p>
					</section>
					<section>
						<p>This is much easier and more robust than manually handling versioned copies of files.</p>
					</section>
				</section>
				<section>
					<section>
						<p>What is a repository?</p>
					</section>
					<section>
						<p>A repository is - simply put - the history of an entire project. It contains all tracked files and the history of their revisions.</p>
					</section>
					<section>
						<p>Version control systems manage project histories through repositories.</p>
					</section>
					<section>
						<p>Version control systems like Git capture <u>snapshots</u> of your work through time.</p>
						<img data-src="img/git_version_tracking.png">
					</section>
				</section>
				<section>
					<section>
						<p>What is Git?</p>
					</section>
					<section>
						<p>Git is known as a DVCS (Distributed Version Control System) specifically designed to help manage distributed projects.</p>
					</section>
					<section>
						<img data-src="img/torvalds.png">
						<p>Git was originally written and released in 2005 by Linus Torvalds - the initial creator of Linux - specifically to help manage Linux kernel development.</p>
					</section>
				</section>
				<section>
					<section>What's so special about Git?</section>
					<section>
						<p>Popular version control systems that work on a centralized client-server model such as CVS (Concurrent Versions System) and its successor SVN (Subversion) require all repository actions to be run through a centralized server.</p>
						<img data-src="img/network.jpg">
					</section>
					<section>
						<p>This forces contributors to connect to a central server to commit changes, making it more difficult to track work on a project independently.</p>
					</section>
					<section>
						<img data-src="img/cvcs.png">
					</section>
					<section>
						Git gives you a local copy of the repository on your machine so you have a copy of the entire project's history and can do all repository actions locally, instead of having to perform them on the server.
					</section>
					<section>
						<img data-src="img/dvcs.png">
					</section>
					<section>
						This makes repository actions such as committing changes for historical tracking extremely fast as it is done locally. You can sync against a remote server at your own leisure.

					<section>What is a hash?</section>
					<section>
						<p>In simplistic terms, a <em>hash</em> is a string generated by a <em>hash function</em> that is (theoretically) unique for each specific given input.</p>
						<p>Mathematically speaking, hash functions should be <em>injective</em> (i.e. one-to-one). This means that using the exact same input should generate the exact same output hash.</p>
						</script>
					</section>
					<section>
						<img data-src="img/simple_hash_function.jpg">
					</section>
					<section>
						<p>What are hashes used for in Git?</p>
					</section>
					<section>
						<p>Hashes serve as integrity checksums to detect whether the data has been corrupted or modified, as well as unique identifiers for all its internal objects.</p>
					</section>
					<section>
						<p>Git uses the SHA-1 hashing algorithm to generate hashes.</p>
					</section>
					<section data-markdown>
						<script type="text/markdown">
							What does a SHA-1 hash look like?
							```
							message: sunlightisawesome
							sha1-digest: 2f7b9fd44585e56bfe250c4554ce15cfc54991c3
							```
							A note on technical terminology:
							- The input to a hash function is also known as a _message_
							- The resulting output hash is also known as the _message digest_, or _digest_ for short
						</script>
					</section>
					<section>
						<p>The terms "hash" and "checksum" are often colloquially interchangable.</p>
						<p>Strictly speaking, <em>checksum</em> is the term for values used to verify data integrity -- this isn't necessarily true of hashes.</p>
					</section>
					<section>
						<p>Using <em>hashes</em> as <em>checksums</em> have the added benefit of being reasonably good unique identifiers.</p>

							1. Do not end the subject line with a period
